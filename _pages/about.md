I am a second year undergradute student from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology([HIT](https://www.hit.edu.cn/)). I graduated from the School of Communication Engineering of Hangzhou Dianzi University.I received scholarships (covering the top 40%) for four consecutive years during my undergraduate studies and was the University's Outstanding Graduate.

My personal research interest includes Generative AI (GAN, diffusion based model), LVM(Large Vision Model), Semantic Communication. My topic now is source-channel joint coding based on 6G communication.
